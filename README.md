# Boston-Data-Festival-2015
A practical approach to using Data Science for real-world tasks associated with processing and analyzing health care data. This immediately useful workshop starts by building a solid foundation of Data Science essentials so that participants will learn how to design a successful Data Science solution properly from day one. The workshop will then present several real-world case studies that offer a step-by-step process for moving Data Science from theory to implementation to practice in a real healthcare setting. The workshop is appropriate for novice to experienced analysts and data scientists interested in healthcare.

GitHub sometimes doesn't like Jupyter Notebooks haing JavaScript, Custom CSS, or HTML embedded. If you are not able to get view the workbooks before donwloading. You can always use http://nbviewer.ipython.org/:
