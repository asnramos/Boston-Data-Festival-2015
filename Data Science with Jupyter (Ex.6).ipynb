    "Since we cannot assume that the correct target feature value for a query instance will be made available shortly after the query has been presented to a deployed model, we will use the stability index. The stability index is an alternative to using the changing model performance by monitoring changes in the distribution of model output as a signal of concept drift. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare distribution, we measure the distribution of model outputs on the test set that was used to orginally evaluate a model and hte repeat this measurment on new sets of query instances collected during periods after the model has been deployed. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used measures for this is the stability index. The stability index is calculate as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$stability\\space index = \\sum_{l\\in levels(t)}^{}((\\frac{\\left |A_{t=l}\\right |}{\\left | A \\right |}-\\frac{\\left | B_{t=l} \\right |}{\\left | B \\right |})\\times log_{e}(\\frac{\\left | A_{t=l} \\right |}{\\left | A \\right |} / \\frac{\\left | B_{t=l} \\right |}{\\left | B \\right |}))$$\n",

    "$$log_{e}$$ is the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other important points:\n",
    "    * If the value of the stability index is less than 0.1, then the distribution of the newly collected test set is broadly similar to the distribution oin the original test set. \n",
    "    * If the value of hte stability index is between 0.1 and 0.25, then some change has occured and further investigation may be useful.\n",
    "    * A stability index value greather than 0.25 suggests that a significant change has occured and corrective action is required. \n",

We assumed they would be able to assist us in the data integration of all the various tables. However, they had prior engagements that pushed our request back 30-days. In the future, we will know what is required of them and confirm their availability. \n",
    "    * We only spent 5% of our time on feature engineering and feature selection combined - this was not sufficient. We would like to make modifications to our workflow to be able to spending 10% of our time on feature engineering and another 10% of our time on feature selection. Beyond the preprocessing of data we felt that this data science project really requires more attention to these areas. "
