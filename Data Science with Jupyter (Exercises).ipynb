    "####Determine Business Objectives\n",
    "1. *Background*\n",
    "    * **Organization**:\n",
    "        * ACME Healthcare\n",
    "    * **Problem Area**:\n",
    "        * Clinical Diagnosis\n",
    "        * As of 2014 there are 8.1 million people or 27.8% of people with diabetes who are undiagnosed. Total costs (both direct and indirect) is estimated to be $245 billion.\n",
    "        * Data Science needs to be promoted as a key way to assist the business.\n",
    "        * The organization is motivated to determine the patient population which has a high-likelihood of type II diabetes in order to offer better care for patients as well as reduce cost of care.\n",
    "        * Target groups we will work with are: chief medical officer, biostatisticians\n",
    "        * The organization is expecting to make use of a high-accuracy model to engage with physicians about their population\n",
    "    * **Current Solution**: \n",
    "        * *Description*: Hospital has rank ordered their patients based on a series of rules that have been identified by clinicians. The hospital is taking the top 5% of the patients who fall into that category and those cases are being reviewed by a physician to determine likelihood of being an underdiagnosed type II diabetic. \n",
    "        * *Advantages/Disadvantages*: Since the solution is more conventional the hospital feels more secure in their findings, although the process is prone to human error.  However, the current process is costly since it involves physicians and there is a significant lag in results as it takes six months to complete a single-iteration.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. *Business objectives*\n",
    "    * Primary Objective: Given a year of EHR data for patients without Diabetes, aim to predict which patients will be diagnosed with diabetes in the next year.\n",
    "    * Other Objectives: What features are most predictive? The business does not want to create unnecessary alarm for their patient population. \n",
    "    * Benefits: The hospital expects that they will considerably reduce cost for the hospital by systematically discovering patients who may have fallen through cracks with regard to type II diabetes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. *Business success criteria*\n",
    "    * A successful and useful outcome for this Data Science project from the hospitals point of view is that they will experience their HCAP scores increase. Improved rankings bode well for the hospital. The potential for increase quality of care will aid the hospital as the healthcare environment swithces from fee-for-service to value-based care. \n",
    "    * Clinicians will assess the success of the program\n",
    "    * The hospital CFO will review the daily operations, budgeting, analytics, and oversight of expenses as it relates to this project. They will be looking for a 7% drop in cost of care within the first 12-months of deploying this model.\n",
    "    * The payers Senior Director, Sales & Marketing will determine the profitable growth and development of increasing patient population through marketing programs around this project. \n",
    "    * The hospital VP, Quality Improvement will determine the value of implementing this Data Science project as a clinical program designed to improve patient health outcome through promotion of preventive care services and management of chronic conditions. \n",
    "     * VP, IT Quality Assurance & Compliance will determine how well this model can be monitored and maintained once in production. \n",
    "    * The business has the aim of predicting the probability that each person has a diagnosis of Type 2 Dieabetes Mellitus which will be evaluated using the log loss metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ log loss = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}log(\\hat{y}_{i})+(1-y_{i})log(1-\\hat{y}_{i}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "$$N$$  is the number of patients \n",
    "$$log$$ is the natural logarithm\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_{i}$$ is the posterior probability that the ith patient has diabetes\n",

    "            * One of the two major types of diabetes, the type in which the beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin but the body is unable to use it effectively because the cells of the body are resistant to the action of insulin. Although this type of diabetes may not carry the same risk of death from ketoacidosis, it otherwise involves many of the same risks of complications as does type 1 diabetes (in which there is a lack of insulin).\n",
    "\n",
    "            * The aim of treatment is to normalize the blood glucose in an attempt to prevent or minimize complications. People with type 2 diabetes may experience marked hyperglycaemia, but many do not require insulin injections and can be treated with diet, exercise, and oral hypoglycemic agents (drugs taken by mouth to lower the blood sugar).\n",
    "\n",
    "            * Type 2 diabetes requires good dietary control including the restriction of calories, lowered consumption of simple carbohydrates and fat with increased consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber. Regular aerobic exercise is also an important method for treating both type 2 diabetes since it decreases insulin resistance and helps burn excessive glucose. Regular exercise also may help lower blood lipids and reduce some effects of stress, both important factors in treating diabetes and preventing complications.\n",

    "5. Costs and Benefits\n",
    "    * Cost of the project: This project will cost \\$600,000 for the first 90-days and then $15,000 month for maintenance of the model.\n",
